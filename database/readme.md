### AWS database

A database is an electronically stored, systematic collection of data. It can contain any type of data, including words, numbers, images, videos, and files. You can use software called a database management system (DBMS) to store, retrieve, and edit data. In computer systems, the word database can also refer to any DBMS, to the database system, or to an application associated with the database.

### Why is a database important ?

A high-performing database is crucial to any organization. Databases support the internal operations of companies and store interactions with customers and suppliers. They also hold administrative information and more specialized data, such as engineering or economic models. Examples include digital library systems, travel reservation systems, and inventory systems. The following are some reasons why databases are essential.

### Efficient scaling

Database applications can manage large amounts of data, scaling to millions, billions, and more. Itâ€™s impossible to store this quantity of digital data without a database.

### Data integrity

Databases often have built-in rules and conditions to maintain data consistency.

### Data security

Databases support privacy and compliance requirements associated with any data. For example, to gain database 
access, users must log in. Different users might also have different levels of access, such as read-only.

### Data analytics

Modern software systems use databases to analyze data. These systems can identify trends and patterns or make predictions. Data analytics help an organization make business decisions with confidence.

AWS databases support all database management tasks, such as server provisioning, patching, configuration, and backups. As a result, you can focus on application development while AWS continuously monitors your databases and automates scaling.

### Examples of AWS database services:

Amazon relational database services (Amazon RDS) is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

Amazon aurora is a relational database built for the cloud. As a fully managed service, it automates time-consuming tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, failure detection, and repair.

Amazon Neptune is a graph-oriented database that can execute more than 100,000 queries per second.

Amazon elasticache is an in-memory NoSQL database that is fully managed, scalable, and secure. It is a popular choice for mobile apps, gaming, e-commerce, and other applications where frequently accessed data must be stored in memory.

### What is database modelling ?

A database model shows the logical structure of a database. It defines the relationships and rules that determine how data can be stored, organized, and manipulated. Each database application is built on a specific data model. Individual database models are designed based on the rules and concepts of the broader data model that the underlying application adopts. 

### Different types of databases are:

Network database
Relational database
Object-oriented database
No-sql database

### Different types of modern databases are:

Graph database
In-memory database
Uses of database,

### Fraud detection

Graph databases help with identity management and fraud detection. Machine learning algorithms find patterns and detect fraudulent activity automatically and preemptively.

### Document management 

NoSQL databases store and manage documents, such as articles and contracts. They also allow organizations to query and index documents.

### Gaming and entertainment

Many gaming and entertainment companies use databases extensively to provide rich media experiences, such as simultaneous login access for millions of users.
