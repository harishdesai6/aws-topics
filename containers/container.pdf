### AWS Containers

Container management tools can be broken down into three categories: registry, orchestration, and compute. AWS offers services that give you a secure place to store and manage your container images, orchestration that manages when and where your containers run, and flexible compute engines to power your containers.

### Registry

#### Amazon Elastic Container Registry

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed container registry that makes it simpler and faster for developers to store, manage, and deploy container images.	

### Orchestration
Amazon Elastic Container Service
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS

### Compute
AWS Fargate
Amazon EC2
AWS App Runner

Containers are popular for deploying and managing applications in the cloud. The container isolates the code and removes the dependencies to other components. Containers are an essential concept in micro service architectures.
